    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Hwang-Geun Yi, a computer science graduate with a deep passion for bridging the gap between hardware and applications through innovative software solutions. I specialize in developing systems that unlock the full potential of modern computing architectures, particularly in the realm of high-performance machine learning infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p>
      This website serves as a digital repository for my academic journey and personal projects. 
      I've carefully selected and migrated content from my Obsidian vault, where I maintain 
      comprehensive notes and documentation in markdown format, to share insights and learnings 
      with the broader community.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My primary areas of interest include <strong>System Software</strong>, <strong>ML Compilers</strong>, 
      <strong>CUTLASS</strong> (CUDA Templates for Linear Algebra Subroutines), and <strong>Compiler Design</strong>. 
      I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning, 
      focusing on optimizing GPU kernels and developing efficient execution engines for large-scale 
      neural network workloads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Through this platform, you'll find various research reviews, technical deep-dives, and project 
      documentation that reflect my exploration of these cutting-edge technologies. I believe in 
      open knowledge sharing and hope these materials prove valuable to fellow researchers and developers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you have any questions, collaboration ideas, or would like to discuss anything related to 
      my work, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded 
      individuals in the field.
